# Simple Text Translator

## Introduction
Welcome to the Simple Text Translator! This Python script uses the `translate` library to translate text from English to Japanese. It's designed to read text from a file (`test.txt`) and output the translation, making it a handy tool for quick translations.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python must be installed on your system.
- The `translate` library is required and can be installed using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install translate
  ```

### Preparing Your Text File
- Create a file named `test.txt` in the same directory as your script.
- Add the text you want to translate to this file. 
  Example content for `test.txt`:
  ```
  Hello! I'm Nilyufar but you can call me Nia
  ```

### Running the Translator
To run the translator, execute the following steps:
1. Open your command line interface.
2. Navigate to the directory containing translator.py and `test.txt`.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python translator.py
   ```

### Output
The translated text will be printed in the console.

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for scenarios like a missing `test.txt` file. It will prompt a message to check the file path if the file is not found.

## Note
This is a basic implementation for educational and demonstrative purposes, showcasing file handling and the use of external libraries in Python.
